## Overview
Rotten Cherry Tomatoes is a spin off of Rotten Tomatoes that focuses on reviews for short films. The app allows users to add, edit, and remove movies, rate and write reviews for movies, view all movies, and search movies. 

## Development
Rotten Cherry Tomatoes was developed using Ruby on Rails as a web framework and Bootstrap as a CSS framework. It utlizes Javascript and jQUERY to perform AJAX requests to reduce the need for page reloads. 

## Notes
Stretch Goals 
- Include use of a movie database api to populate the database rather than relying on user input. 
- Add profile and account page for user
- Allow user to add movies to 'want to see' or mark movies as 'not interested'
- Add movie trailers to 'show movie' page

Known Bugs
- Search does not work from 'show movie' page
- User profile/account links in navbar don't direct anywhere as these pages do not yet exist.
